Hi there,
My name is mukarram.
I recently started my journey into full stack development at CFI (Code For India), and I'm currently diving into HTML and CSS in my first week. Learning these languages has been a mix of enjoyment and challenge. 
HTML, which helps structure web pages and create different elements like headings and paragraphs, has been straightforward to understand.
On the other hand, CSS has presented some difficulties, especially when it comes to colors and styling. 
CSS is all about making websites look attractive and organized, but figuring out which colors to use and how to apply styles can be tricky. 
I'm learning to use CSS rules to change the appearance of elements like fonts, colors, margins, and more. It's a creative process that requires attention to detail and experimentation, and i also find it a bit tricky when it comes to some specific commands in CSS which makes me realise that am definitely not a creative guy when it comes to colours and styling part.
Despite the challenges, I'm enjoying the hands-on experience and the support provided by my instructor. 
The practical exercises and guidance from instructor is helping me grasp these concepts better. 
Looking ahead, I'm excited about learning JavaScript and other backend technologies in the full stack development curriculum. 
I believe these skills will encourage me to create interactive websites and applications in the future.
Overall, while there are challenges in learning, I'm motivated by the opportunity to acquire valuable skills that will help me in the way for a rewarding career in web development.
